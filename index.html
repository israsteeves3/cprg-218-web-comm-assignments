        This small town has a population of approximately 5,800 people, and has plenty of things to do! There is a public recreation centre, 
        a bowling alley, plenty of outdoor skating arenas, and of course, West Stettler Park. A playground was put up in the park in 2015, and there is a spray park as well,

            <p>
                Walking through West Stettler after work one day, I found a kitten on the side of the path. He became my first foster kitten, and he was named Atlas. 
                Atlas had an upper respiratory tract infection when I found him. Once he was healthy again, I found a loving home for him.

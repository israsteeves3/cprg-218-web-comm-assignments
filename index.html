        Stettler Alberta is located about eighty kilometres east of Red Deer AB, and about 100 kilometres from Drumheller AB. 
        This small town has a population of approximately 5,800 people, and has plenty of things to do! There is a public recreation centre, 
        a bowling alley, plenty of outdoor skating arenas, and of course, West Stettler Park. A playground was put up in the park in 2015, 
        and there is a spray park as well, with shower facilities and everything you could need for a fun day out with the kids!

            <p>
                West Stettler Park is home to plenty of festivities during Canada Day each year, including the annual fireworks display! Many other things are happening in and 
                around town on Canada Day. In the morning there is a free pancake breakfast offered at the Stettler Community Hall. This is followed by the Canada Day Parade at eleven am. 
                Family Fun Day at the Stettler Museum runs most of the day, and in the evening while waiting for the fireworks to begin there is evening entertainment in the form of live music 
                at the gazebo at West Stettler Park, and food trucks are on site while everyone waits for the fireworks to start.

            <p>
                Walking through West Stettler after work one day, I found a kitten on the side of the path. He became my first foster kitten, and he was named Atlas. 
                Atlas had an upper respiratory tract infection when I found him. Once he was healthy again, I found a loving home for him with a local family.

    <p>West Stettler Park is home to plenty of festivities during Canada Day each year, including the annual fireworks display! Other things happening in and around town are a free pancake breakfast offered at the Stettler Community Hall, the Canada Day Parade, Family Fun Day at the Stettler Museum, Evening Entertainment, including live music, at the gazebo at West Stettler Park, and food trucks are on site while everyone waits for the fireworks to start.  </p>
